# üìÑ `.proj` File Format Specification & Runtime Documentation

## üîß Overview

`.proj` is a **stack-based scripting file format** used to describe command pipelines. It is interpreted by a Rust CLI that supports directives (top-level named blocks), each containing commands to manipulate a runtime stack, interact with the file system, print output, and run shell commands.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

A `.proj` file is composed of **named blocks**, each associated with a directive. Each block is a set of **commands** enclosed in `{ ... }`.

### ‚úÖ Syntax

```proj
main {
  "Hello,"
  " world!"
  concat
  echo
}
```

### ‚úÖ Rules

* Each **block** starts with an identifier (directive name) followed by `{`.
* Commands inside blocks are interpreted in order.
* Duplicate block names are disallowed.
* Tokens include: Identifiers, String literals, Integers, and Macros.

## üî£ Token Types

| Type          | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Identifier    | Used for block names and command keywords      |
| StringLiteral | `"A string"` ‚Äì pushed to stack as `Value::Str` |
| Integer       | `123` ‚Äì pushed as `Value::Int(i64)`            |
| Macro         | Expands to the defined set of commands         |

---

## üîß Commands

Each block contains a sequence of the following commands:

| Command      | Stack Behavior                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"string"`   | Push a string to the stack                                 |
| `123`        | Push an integer to the stack                               |
| `echo`       | Pop a string and print it to stdout                        |
| `dup`        | Duplicate the top stack element                            |
| `pop`        | Remove the top stack element                               |
| `swap`       | Swap the top two elements                                  |
| `concat`     | Pop two strings, concatenate, and push result              |
| `readfile`   | Pop a file path string, read the file, and push contents   |
| `writefile`  | Pop (content, path) strings and write to file              |
| `if { ... }` | Pop an integer. If non-zero, execute enclosed block        |
| `load name`  | Load another block named `name` and execute its commands   |
| `shell`      | Pop a command string, run it with `sh -c`, and push output |

### üß† Macros

* `log_shell`: Expands to `dup`, `echo`, and `shell`.

---

## üìÅ Example

```proj
main {
  "echo 'Hello from Shell'"
  log_shell
}
```

This will:

1. Push the shell command string.
2. Duplicate it.
3. Echo it to stdout.
4. Run it with the shell and print the result.

---

## üßµ Runtime Execution

The `.proj` runtime works by:

1. Loading the `.proj` file into a map of `HashMap<String, Block>`.
2. Locating the block by directive name (e.g., `main`).
3. Executing the list of `Command`s in that block using a LIFO stack (`Vec<Value>`).
4. Supporting nested execution via `load` and conditional blocks via `if`.

---

## üß± Runtime Stack

Backed by a `Vec<Value>`, where:

```rust
enum Value {
    Nil,
    Str(String),
    Int(i64),
}
```

Operations ensure type safety and error handling for incorrect operations (e.g., popping an Int where a String is expected).

## ‚ùó Errors & Diagnostics

* **Redefinition of block** ‚Üí Error at parse time.
* **Invalid token** ‚Üí Lexer-level error.
* **Unknown identifier/macro** ‚Üí Parsing error.
* **Stack underflow or type mismatch** ‚Üí Runtime error.
* **Missing block (load/entry)** ‚Üí Runtime error.
